# Gridlib
This is an assortion of funtions to create grids from Points and Lines.

See [this article](https://maximilianehlers.com/blog/gridlib/) for more information.

If you would like explanations for the algorithms or something does not work the way you thought, please open an issue and I will be sure to take a look!

Any gitcoin bounty will of course be quickly fixed.
